Maker Movement Introduction
###########################

There's a more humane path to human wealth than creating a global commodity economy. I believe by
fully exploring the limits of the maker movement. Maker communities have some very interesting
characteristics:

#. Capital is often shared or jointly owned
#. Capital is bootstrapped by making machines to make machines
#. Designs are open source, items are copied, modified and forked into new designs

Yet, makers are hobbyists or artisans. Making doesn't play the major role in the economy that
I think it could. The Etsy marketcap is probably the limit of current capabilities, but I think the
impact of a maker economy could replace most big box grocery and home goods stores.

Assumptions:

#. There are valuable items including food, clothing, furniture, iot electronics that can be make
   using modern maker tools with relatively little crafting skill.
#. Sharing and bootstrapping capital can allow low risk investment in getting started with many of
   these 'consumer level' projects.
#. The inputs for such projects can be met largely with commodity resources that are locally
   sourced. Special inputs are still supplied from global markets.
#. Food and yard related projects should require the least amount of input capital for suburban
   Americans.
#. There are many ways of increasing average person participation in a maker economy:

   #. Advance universal printers in terms of capabilities and accessibility
   #. Increase access to specialized tools
   #. Increase the breadth of projects out there
   #. Increase the accessibility of starting and completing projects through:

      #. training
      #. project recommendations
      #. project automation (of planning, supply chain, documentation)
