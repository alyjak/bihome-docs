Startup idea checklist

.. quote::

   I’ve been tinkering with different startup ideas and needed a good checklist to think through
   them. There are great templates for this already: The YC application, Amazon’s internal press
   release, and Sequoia’s Writing a Business Plan. I found myself mixing and tweaking these templates
   because they don’t exactly match my model of the world, so I wrote up my own list.

   I use this list both to develop ideas and filter them. If you adopt it, be careful about using it as
   a filter. Remember that in the early stages, good ideas are very easy to kill.

   Thanks to Darryl Ramm for feedback on this post.
