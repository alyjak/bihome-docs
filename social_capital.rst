A social wealth marketplace app

This was spawned from listening to this Hidden Brain episode: https://open.spotify.com/episode/5OzG1opecbeJvij92NObmQ?si=7TUL5wATSkmhlui4DFucEQ

The Big Idea: politics is turning into a spectator sport. We have our teams and we sit on the couch
and watch them. Politics is supposted to be about power. We need to turn spectators into
players. Create an app to teach everyone how to be a socially responsible politician. Gamify it such
that you can have your own stats and track your performance.

Manifesto:
   This is an app to combat the trend of politics turning into sports. Politics isn't about who's team
   wins or loses. Politics is about assessing our shared problems and working together to solve those
   problems. This is an app to turn political spectators into political agents. Politics starts at
   home, then reaches to your neighborhood. So does this app. This app help you acquire real political
   power. This can also earn you money. This app isn't a game, but it might be a sport which is played
   out in face-to-face society. This is an app that will challenge you to reach out and have
   uncomfortable talks. This is an app that will improve you. This is an app that will give you real
   power and teach you how to use it. This is an app that will allow you to help stitch together our
   broken social fabric and mend a stronger healthier society.

   Track your social wealth for fun and profit

*************
Fundamentals:
*************

* The digital side of this occurs through your phone. You can't perform most of the functions
  through a laptop -- this is because most of the functions require you to be physically
  present. Similar concept to Pokemon Go / Ingress
* This is a face-to-face app first and formost. Most ways of earning social wealth have to end in
  "handshakes" Which are phone-to-phone nfc bumps.
* Surveys to define who you are in your political beliefs: This helps you find out who you are close
  to and far apart from across different issues. Results are restricted to people you are physically
  close to in order to help encourage socially positive behavior. Similar concept to OK cupid but
  for politics
* Social Currency: Every player gets a minimum social currency to contribute to programs/voices in
  their local networks. There is also social capital that is less liquid, but also part of your
  player 'value'
* Digital communication is limited to your immediate location (GPS determined via app)
* Social capital is gained by increasing your connection to this network
* Social currency/capital can be increased through quest-like activities: invest to throw a
  block party, get a return based on other players who show up. Heal a divide: host an intimate
  debate to better understand differences in political opinions in your community
* Track who you are as a political agent. Use your data driven (your actions, communities, + survey
  results) to get an idea of how you align with a politician's record or a piece of legislation.
* Get training in the tools to change policies: Be able to draft proposals for change
* Social currency can be spent to help influence real life political activities on the neighborhood,
  city, county, state, or national levels. <- Similar to Andrew Yang's democracy dollars
* Moderators can be local party bosses: They can help reach neighborhood consensus on issues and
  work with elected power to actualize that consensus.
* Federated grid of data. Data is secured based on map regions. Each region has moderators who have
  full read/write access to the live data. Data is secured through a sharded key - moderators each
  get keys and potentially multiple keys are necessary to unlock the data. No centralized authority
  has access to all the data. Data is backed up regularly and all members have access to the back
  ups (for malignant moderators).
* Fractal Grids: Moderators for a region are responsible for aggregating and broadcasting to their
  region.
* Other dimension of grids besides just regional: Topic grids. Can become subject matter experts,
  responsible for aggregating specific topic areas for a larger sized grid.
* Moderators can also broadcast their own content to their grid
* Moderators are community supported -- part of the social currency goes into the moderators you
  choose to support
* Community credentials are aggregated based on your social wealth -- capital and currency. Gaining
  social wealth is always tied to a direct socially positive action you accomplished
* Vote with your networks: throw polls, draft neighborhood policies. Fund neighborhood improvements
  or charity drives. Tie projects to kickstarter style funding requirements. This is also how
  improvements to the app can be funded.
* Attempt to encourage local government buy in and investment in this software as a way of
  increasing community participation. One way to encourage this behavior is there should be a
  committment to keeping the code base open source.
* In game currency: Be able to convert social currency to local currency
* Subscription Fee: Be able to support your community through patreon-like funding mechanisms
* UBI: everyone gets some minimal level of currency: but how is this funded? Some portion of the
  proceeds you allocate towards specific purposes is distributed for the UBI and for maintaining the
  app and servers
* Your voice can naturally distribute to your adjacent communities if its amplified enough through
  your peers responses. Otherwise all messages have time + distance exponential die off.
* Abiity to credentialize opinions: Be able to weight survey and post broadcast strength based on
  the level of respect an individual has gained in the community where the information is being
  transferred.
* Its ok, and even encouraged to go into social debt. This is a way of making lasting social
  bonds. Not all types of social currency are fungible with one another

Storyboards
***********

* Your local map. Overlays of: neighboring maps, portion of participants vs census reported
  households. Political districts.
* Your local bulleten board: babysitting, get-togethers, potlucks, yard help
* Your local calendar
* Your news feed(s) (based on your moderators, and your topic areas)
* Take surveys
* Survey stats: How your basic survey data compares to census and election stats for your
  area. Ideas for follow on quests to investigate discrepancies: get more people involved, hints for
  things that may be going on under the surface. Is it likely some are barely getting by? Are there
  ideological rifts?
* Track your social investments: track the status of your social capital: do you need to renew/increase
  your face-to-face with your network? Are you involved in a public works program, is it
  progressing? Educational programs? Extended family programs (weekly dinners etc).
* Subscription configuration
* Moderator tools: approve posts, recommend posts, access to community data that can be aggregated
  and broadcast. Approve data transfer to the next layer moderator(s). Request help (social or technical)
